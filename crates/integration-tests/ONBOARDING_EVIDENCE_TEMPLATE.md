# Protocol Onboarding Evidence Template

> Copy this file to `crates/integration-tests/onboarding/<protocol>/evidence.md` for each protocol onboarding run.
> This is a completion gate, not a nice-to-have note. If any mandatory row is missing, the phase is incomplete.

## Blockers

If a mandatory item cannot be completed, write `blocked` rather than `done`.

| blocker | source | next action |
|---|---|---|
| | | |

## Final Completion Claim

Do not write "onboarding complete" unless every mandatory P0/P1/P2/P3/P4 row is `done` or has a concrete, user-visible `blocked` disposition and this command passes:

```bash
cargo run -p policy-engine-integration-tests --bin check-onboarding-evidence -- <protocol> --phase all
```
