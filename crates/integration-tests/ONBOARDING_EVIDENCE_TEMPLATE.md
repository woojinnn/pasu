# Protocol Onboarding Evidence Template

> Copy this file to `crates/integration-tests/onboarding/<protocol>/evidence.md` for each protocol onboarding run.
> This is a completion gate, not a nice-to-have note. If any mandatory row is missing, the phase is incomplete.
>
> **SSOT:** this template is the single source of truth for *per-phase evidence requirements* — `check-onboarding-evidence` parses it and cross-checks every mandatory row. The spine's §2.1b table, §3.1 P0 step, and §8.6 self-check summarize it; on conflict, this file wins. (The definition of "onboarded" itself lives in `PROTOCOL_AGNOSTIC_ONBOARDING_FRAMEWORK.md` §6.)

## Run Metadata

| field | value |
|---|---|
| protocol | |
| branch | |
| worktree | |
| date | |
| main agent | |
| base commit | |

## Scope Classification

Use this section to make the final claim precise. This table is narrative
evidence; the phase tables below are the mandatory gate.

| field | value |
|---|---|
| representative chain (SINGLE — multichain = separate framework, deferred) | |
| completion target | `wallet-facing` / `full-surface` / `full factory-child universe` |
| **pre-decision** cross-entry volume distribution (tx-share of EACH user-facing entry; which dominates) — measured BEFORE the cover/defer boundary (H1) | |
| per-cover-candidate wrapper/router selector child resolution-rate (effective coverage = decoded children / real children; NOT manifest-presence) (H3) | |
| covered real-usage coverage-share — **volume-weighted protocol-level**: Σ covered top-level tx / Σ all top-level tx across every user-facing entry (NOT per-contract selector-share) (H2), wrappers counted by child resolution-rate (H3) | |
| user-facing DEFERs, each with its 1st-party usage-share (%/count) | |
| direct factory-child calls | covered / source-materialized sample / deferred / not applicable |
| final claim label (MUST NOT over-claim the measured coverage-share above) | |

## Blockers

If a mandatory item cannot be completed, write `blocked` rather than `done`.

| blocker | source | next action |
|---|---|---|
| | | |

## Final Completion Claim

Do not write "onboarding complete" unless every mandatory P0/P1/P2/P3/P4 row is `done` or has a concrete, user-visible `blocked` disposition and this command passes:

```bash
cargo run -p policy-engine-integration-tests --bin check-onboarding-evidence -- <protocol> --phase all
```
